## Bio
I have just completed my PhD in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. I love to play with data and enjoy 
developing data-driven applications. I have experience in developing machine learning applications for the healthcare 
organizations. I have also developed a scalable machine learning framework that supports continuous learning and evaluation. I 
am also a software engineer. I worked as a software engineer with some well-reputed software companies. I obtained 
my MSc degree in Advanced Computer Science and IT Management with distinction from The University of Manchester,
the UK in 2017.

## Hiking 
In my spare time, I like to go for hiking. Hiking is a great way to explore new places and spend time with nature. 
My favourite destinations are mountains, lakes, beaches, and forests. The photo below was taken in 2015 during a tour to 
a remote lake known as ["Boga Lake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagakain_Lake)  in the hill district Bandarban, Bangladesh.
