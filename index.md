## Bio
I have just completed my PhD in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I love to play with data and enjoy 
developing data-driven applications. I have experience in developing machine learning applications for the healthcare 
domain. I have also developed a scalable machine learning framework that supports continuous learning and evaluation. I 
am also a software engineer. I worked as a software engineer with some well-reputed software companies. I obtained 
my MSc degree in Advanced Computer Science and IT Management with distinction from The University of Manchester,
the UK in 2017.
