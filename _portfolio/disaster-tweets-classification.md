Twitter is a popular social media platform where users share posts short texts to express their feelings to others. Such
Tweets often contain useful information about critical situations such as disasters. If the information is extracted and
processed efficiently, it could be used to quickly respond to the situation and make informed decisions. However, it is
a challenging task to separate the disaster-related Tweets from others due to the unstructured nature
of text data.

In this project, I have developed a transfer learning-based approach to detect whether a Tweet is about a disaster or
not. I have fine-tuned a pretrained DistilBERT model that on the
Kaggle ["Natural language processing with disaster Tweets"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) dataset. The
model achieves more than 83% accuracy on the test set.
